<h1>VPE</h1>
<h2>Version 12 enhancements</h2>
<p>Version 12 added support for VPE in GT.M environments.</p>
<h2>Version 11 enhancements</h2>
<p> The following is a brief description of the enhancements included in VPE version 
  11.</p>
<h3>Routine Editor</h3>

  </span></span> <span style='font-family:Arial'>Versioning</span><br>
  <br>
  The <i>Library</i> module has been enhanced to include versioning. When you 
  edit a routine and save your changes, you will be prompted to create a version 
  of the routine. You can create a new version or update an existing version. 
  The version is stored in the VPE Version file and can be restored at anytime 
  via the <i>..LBRY</i> menu. Read the Help option in system QWIK <i>..LBRY</i> 
  for more information.</p>

  </span></span> <span style='font-family:Arial'>Saving Code To The Clipboard</span><br>
  <br>
  The editor&#146;s <i>Cut</i>/<i>Copy</i>/<i>Paste</i> functions have been enhanced 
  to allow you to copy a portion of a line of code to the clipboard and paste 
  it back in at a different location.<br>
  <br>
  <u>Old Method<br>
  </u><br>
  To copy code, hit <b>&lt;F3&gt;</b> to put the editor into Block mode. The word 
  <i>Block</i> will appear in the upper right of the screen. While in Block mode, 
  hit the <b>&lt;AU&gt;</b> or <b>&lt;AD&gt;</b> key to highlight lines of code. 
  <b>&lt;ESC C&gt;</b> will copy the highlighted code to the clipboard and turn 
  off Block mode. <b>&lt;ESC X&gt;</b> will do the same but will also delete the 
  lines. Move the cursor to a new line and hit <b>&lt;ESC V&gt;</b> to paste the 
  code into the new location. The code is inserted just below the line the cursor 
  is on. While in Block mode, <b>&lt;AL&gt;</b> highlights all lines from the 
  cursor to the top of the routine, and <b>&lt;AR&gt;</b> highlights all lines 
  from the cursor to the bottom of the routine. Also, you can <b>&lt;TAB&gt;</b> 
  to the Menu Bar and hit <b>R</b> to branch to another routine to Copy/Cut code, 
  and then exit and Paste it into the main routine.<br>
  <br>
  <u>New Method<br>
  </u><br>
  Hit <b>&lt;F3&gt;</b> to put the editor into Block mode. Hit <b>&lt;AU&gt;</b> 
  or <b>&lt;AD&gt;</b> to highlight <b>lines</b> of code, and <b>&lt;AL&gt;</b> 
  or <b>&lt;AR&gt;</b> to highlight <b>characters</b> of code. When highlighting 
  characters of code, you may only highlight characters from a single line, excluding 
  the line tag.<br>
  <br>
  <b>&lt;ESC V&gt;</b> will paste the code to the new location of the cursor, 
  but it will do it differently depending on whether the clipboard has <b>lines</b> 
  or <b>characters</b> of code. If you&#146;re pasting lines, the new lines will 
  be inserted below the line the cursor is currently on. If you&#146;re pasting 
  characters, the characters will be inserted into the current line at the point 
  where the cursor is located. If you are in Block mode and have highlighted some 
  code, <b>&lt;ESC V&gt;</b> will replace that code with the contents of the clipboard.<br>
  <br>
  While in Block mode, hit <b>&lt;HOME&gt;</b> to highlight lines from the cursor 
  to the top of the routine, and <b>&lt;END&gt;</b> to highlight lines from the 
  cursor to the bottom of the routine.<br>
  <br>
  Here is a summary of keys used to Cut/Copy/Paste:<br>
        <b>&lt;F3&gt;</b>               Turn Block mode <b>on</b> &amp; <b>off</b>.<br>
        <b>&lt;AU&gt; &lt;AD&gt;</b>   Highlight <b>lines</b> of code.<br>
        <b>&lt;AL&gt; &lt;AR&gt;</b>   Highlight <b>characters</b> of code.<br>
        <b>&lt;DEL&gt;</b>            When Block mode is <b>on</b>, delete highlighted 
  lines/characters.<br>
        <b>&lt;ESC C&gt;</b>        <b>Copy</b> highlighted code to the clipboard.<br>
        <b>&lt;ESC D&gt;</b>        Block mode <b>off</b> - Delete current line.<br>
                                Block mode <b>on</b> - Delete highlighted lines/characters.<br>
        <b>&lt;ESC X&gt;</b>        <b>Cut</b> highlighted code to the clipboard.<br>
        <b>&lt;ESC V&gt;</b>        <b>Paste</b> code from the clipboard into 
  the routine.<br>
                                   <span>Ø</span> <b>Lines</b> will be inserted 
  below the current line.<br>
                                   <span>Ø</span> <b>Characters</b> will be inserted 
  into the current line.<br>
                                If you are in Block mode when you hit <b>&lt;ESC 
  V&gt;</b>, highlighted<br>
                                code will be replaced by the contents of the clipboard.<br>
        <b>&lt;HOME&gt;</b>       Highlight from the cursor to the <b>top</b> 
  of the routine.<br>
        <b>&lt;END&gt;</b>           Highlight from the cursor to the <b>bottom</b> 
  of the routine.</p>

  </span></span> <span style='font-family:Arial'>Find Tag</span><br>
  <br>
  The <i>Find Tag</i> option on the editor&#146;s menu bar has been enhanced. 
  It now lists all line tags in the routine and allows you to select a tag and 
  move to it. While in the editor, hit <b>&lt;TAB&gt;</b> to go to the menu bar 
  and then type <b>F</b> for Find Tag. </p>

  </span></span> <span style='font-family:Arial'>NoDt<br>
  </span><br>
  In previous versions of VPE, you could set the variable <i>VEENODT =1</i> to 
  tell the editor not to update the date on the top line of the routine when you 
  saved your changes. This allowed you to make temporary changes to a routine 
  for testing purposes and then remove the changes and restore the routine back 
  to exactly the way it was before. However, you did have to remember to set VEENODT 
  and also to KILL the variable when your editing was done. Using this variable 
  is no longer necessary. Now, when you exit an editing session, you are prompted 
  with:<br>
                    <b>QUIT  SAVE  SAVE_AS  SAVE_NODT</b><br>
  Choose <b><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>SAVE_NODT</span></b> to save 
  your changes without updating the date on the top line.<span style='font-family:
Arial'></span></p>
<p> <span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span style='font-family:Arial'>Routine Search</span><br>
  <br>
  To reach the <i>Routine Search</i> module, hit <b>&lt;TAB&gt;</b> to move to 
  the menu bar and then type <b>RS</b>. This module allows you to list all routines 
  edited on, before, or after a certain date by entering the search criteria in 
  the following syntax:<br>
                    &lt;10/12/00        Find all routines edited <b>before</b> 
  Dec 10, 2000.<br>
                    &gt;10/12/00        Find all routines edited <b>after</b> 
  Dec 10, 2000.<br>
                    =10/12/00        Find all routines edited <b>on</b> Dec 10, 
  2000.<br>
  <br>
  This functionality stopped working when the year became 00. It has been fixed 
  and now supports the year 2000.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span style='font-family:Arial'>Inserting a New Line of Code</span><br>
  <br>
  To insert a new line of code in the editor, hit &lt;RET&gt; to open a blank 
  line. It doesn&#146;t matter where your cursor is positioned when you hit &lt;RET&gt;, 
  it will always open a blank line just below the line your cursor is on.<br>
  <br>
  Once you&#146;ve opened a blank line you either hit &lt;TAB&gt; and start entering 
  your code, or type a line tag and then hit &lt;TAB&gt;. If you hit &lt;RET&gt; 
  again before you enter any code (or &lt;BS&gt;), the blank line will close. 
  From the time you hit &lt;RET&gt; to open a blank line, and the time you hit 
  &lt;TAB&gt;, the editor is in a special mode where it is trying to determine 
  whether you&#146;ve entered a valid line tag. This special mode has been changed 
  slightly.<br>
  <br>
  If you entered some code and then hit &lt;RET&gt; before hitting &lt;TAB&gt;, 
  you used to get a message saying that a line tag must be followed by a &lt;TAB&gt;, 
  and it would keep you right there. This has been changed. If you enter some 
  text on a blank line and then hit &lt;RET&gt;, the editor goes ahead and puts 
  the &lt;TAB&gt; there for you and then continues on as if you had entered the 
  &lt;TAB&gt;. Like before, it then checks the tag to make sure it is valid.</p>

  </span></span> <span style='font-family:Arial'>Keys &amp; Indexes</span><br>
  <br>
  In VEDD&#146;s main menu, the <i>Cross References</i> option has been changed 
  to <i>Keys &amp; Indexes</i>. It now includes sections for Keys, New-style Indexes, 
  and Old-style Indexes. Keys and new-style indexes were introduced in Fileman 
  version 22.<br>

  Information on Keys and New-style Indexes has been added to the Individual Field 
  Summary display. In addition, text now displays with a more natural appearance, 
  making fields such as the DESCRIPTION field easier to read.<span
